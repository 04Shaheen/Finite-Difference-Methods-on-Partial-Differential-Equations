# Finite-Difference-Methods-on-Partial-Differential-Equations
Using numerical approaches to solve Partial Differential Equations as opposed to using classical methods
First we used Runge-Kutta (RK2 and RK4) methods to formulate ordinary differential equations numerically. We applied the Runge Kutta functions to three different types of systems of ODEs 1) linear spring-mass system, 2) non-linear predator prey model, 3) chaotic lorenz system.
We proceeded to use Explicit Schemes to model two kinds of Partial Differential Equations, 1) The transport (advection) equation and 2) the heat (diffusion) equation.
The schemes we used were
FTFS - Forward in Time, Forward in Space
FTBS - Forward in Time, Backward in Space
FTCS - Forward in Time, Centered in Space
Lax-Wendroff Scheme
We then used implicit methods:
BTFS - Backward in Time, Forward in Space
BTBS = Backward in Time, Backward in Space
BTCS - Backward in Time, Centered in Space
We made inferences on the stability, consistency and convergence of the different schemes selectively applied on both the equations.
We also compared some of the results obtained from the finite difference schemes with the analytical solutions.
